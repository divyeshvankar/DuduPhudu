# Store Redirect Page

This HTML page is designed to redirect users to different store URLs based on their country.

## Description

This page utilizes JavaScript to fetch the user's country using an IP geolocation API and then redirects them accordingly. Users from Canada, USA, and Mexico are redirected to [https://www.duduphudu.store/](https://www.duduphudu.store/), users from India are redirected to [https://duduphudu.blinkstore.in/shop](https://duduphudu.blinkstore.in/shop), and users from all other countries are redirected to [https://duduphudueurope.store/](https://duduphudueurope.store/).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the HTML file and the GIF image (`GIF_FINAL.gif`) to your project directory.
2. Include the HTML file in your project and ensure the GIF image is in the same directory or update the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag accordingly.
3. Customize the redirection URLs if necessary by modifying the JavaScript code.
4. Test the page to ensure it redirects users correctly based on their country.
